    <h1>Ansible</h1>
    <p>This hands-on foundational Ansible training course is designed to give IT, DevOps and other technology professionals a
    comprehensive introduction to the Ansible IT automation engine. Through lecture and intensive lab work, attendees will
    gain a clear understanding of Ansible's capabilities for provisioning, configuration management, deployment, and
    orchestration. Discussion will include the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) methodology and how Ansible accomplishes state
    enforcement with simple, easy to remember declaration syntax.</p>

    <p>Students will experience using Ansible to complete configuration management tasks on server infrastructure and
    networking devices. Labs will guide attendees through a range of topics from learning basic Ansible ad-hoc commands to
    creating role-based playbooks that use the Jinja2 templating engine and syntax to ensure maximum flexibility and
    reusability of playbooks and supporting code.</p>

    <p>Upon completion of the course, attendees will have a clear understanding of Ansible concepts and constructs, network
    automation using Ansible, IaC methodology & techniques, Ansible best practices, and will be prepared to start using
    Ansible to efficiently manage infrastructure at their organization.</p>

    <p>This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for onsite and online delivery.</p>

    <h1>Ansible and OpenStack</h1>

    <p>This hands-on training course is designed to give IT, DevOps and other technology professionals a detailed introduction
    to using Ansible to deploy an OpenStack cloud. Attendees will gain familiarity with the official OpenStack-Ansible
    project; Ansible concepts (commands, roles, templates), Ansible playbooks, Ansibleâ€™s role in OpenStack cloud
    orchestration and will leave with a clear understanding of the ways in which Ansible can simplify the configuration and
    deployment of an OpenStack cloud.</p>

    <p>Various Ansible and OpenStack-based deployment labs are performed throughout the course including a full Ansible
    all-in-one (AIO) cloud deployment. Upon completion of the course, attendees will have a clear understanding of Ansible
    and its capabilities as an OpenStack configuration management and orchestration tool and will have learned the skills
    necessary to deploy an OpenStack cloud with Ansible in development and testing scenarios.</p>

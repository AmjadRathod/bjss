description: 'RX-M offers three tiers of Docker learning: a foundation training course enabling attendees to begin integrating Docker
with their development, test and deployment processes; an advanced course that will provide the necessary skills for
attendees to effectively leverage Docker in sophisticated enterprise environments; and targeted content on Docker
Compose, Docker Stacks, Docker Swarm, container networking, and state management (volumes).'

        <h1>Docker Foundation</h1>
        <p>This intensive three-day hands-on Docker training course is designed to provide working developers, DevOps staff and
        other technology professionals with a comprehensive introduction to Docker. Attendees will leave with a clear
        understanding of the architectural constructs in the Linux kernel enabling Docker; how containers are used in
        development, test and production settings; Docker OSS & commercial products and their place in the market; as well as
        how other players in the container ecosystem fit in to various Docker solution stacks.</p>
        <p>During the course students will gain hands on experience with the Docker command line, Dockerfiles and Docker image
        architecture. The course covers Container operations in depth and exposes attendees to the full range of Docker
        subcommands and Dockerfile instructions in their entirety so that, upon completion of the course, attendees will have
        the skills and information necessary to begin integrating container technology with their development, test and
        deployment processes. The course wraps with an introduction to advanced topics such as Docker volume, security,
        networking and clustering, providing a natural transition when combined with RX-M's advanced Docker training course.</p>
        <p>This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for onsite and online delivery.</p>

        <h1>Advanced Docker</h1>
        <p>This two-day hands-on Docker training course is designed to pick up where RX-M's Docker Foundation course leaves off; it
        provides in-depth coverage of the advanced aspects of Docker and orchestration tools commonly used to deploy and
        maintain containerized application infrastructures. Attendees will leave with a detailed understanding of container
        networking internals and multi-host networking, security concerns, cgroup constraints and namespace isolation
        mechanisms.</p>
        <p>Discussion includes a look at the evolving microservice-based ecosystem and the relationship between Docker and the Open
        Container Initiative (OCI) standards. Docker architecture is examined at the runC, containerD and Engine levels.
        Students will gain experience with Docker API operations and distributed Docker configuration. Key orchestration tools
        used with Docker will also be introduced, including Docker Machine and Docker Swarm.</p>
        <p>The skills and knowledge developed in this course will be particularly useful to system designers and architects
        interested in leveraging the best features of containers and avoiding common pitfalls. Upon completion of the course
        attendees will have the skills and information necessary to effectively integrate Docker and containers into
        sophisticated enterprise environments.</p>

        <h1>Docker Compose</h1>
        <p>This one day course is designed to provide existing users of Docker with a comprehensive look at Docker Compose and
        container configuration possibilities made available by Compose. Students are introduced to Compose and its purpose;
        will be exposed to the entire Compose DSL; will have the chance to install Compose and define and build basic Compose
        applications. This course examines the strengths and weaknesses of Compose when used in a production setting, including
        its integration with Docker Swarm and its use of the new Distributed Application Bundle (DAB) image format.</p>
        <p>Upon completion of this compact, intensive hands-on course, students will have an in-depth understanding of Compose and
        its use cases, as well as the ability to immediately use Compose in development and testing applications.</p>

        <h1>Docker Swarm</h1>
        <p>This one day hands-on course is designed to provide Docker users comprehensive coverage of Docker's native orchestration
        tool, Docker Swarm. The course begins with an introduction to the Docker Swarm architecture followed by a lab which
        configures a small Swarm cluster. Nodes and node configurations are covered, introducing attendees to managers and
        workers the Raft and Gossip protocols and various docker commands for working with clusters. The new Distributed
        Application Bundle (DAB) image format is covered along with stacks, services, tasks, nodes and other Docker Swarm
        primitives. Docker services are covered in depth, including replicated and global service operation, scaling features,
        tasks, task states, the Docker service routing mesh, services discovery and failover.</p>
        <p>Upon completion of this intensive hands-on course, students will have an in-depth understanding of Swarm and its use
        cases, as well as the ability to immediately begin using Swarm in development, test and production scenarios.</p>

        <h1>Docker Networking</h1>
        <p>This intensive one day hands-on training course is designed to provide working developers, DevOps staff, networking
        engineers and other technology professionals with an intensive, yet compact introduction to Docker networking. Attendees
        will leave with a clear understanding of software-defined networks in relation to Docker, types of drivers and how they
        interact with Docker, networking methodologies and Docker's place in the SDN space.</p>

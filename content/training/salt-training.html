    <p>RX-M's Salt training course teaches a best-practice approach to managing infrastructure using Salt configuration
    automation software and provides system administrators with the skills to implement Salt in complex enterprise
    environments. Students will take part in extensive hands-on labs, gaining experience and improving retention of concepts
    and processes covered by lecture and presentations. Topics covered include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remote execution</li>
      <li>Job &amp; event management</li>
      <li>Implementation of Salt States</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Students will learn how to write parameterized Salt States that leverage the Jinja templating engine or custom Python
      code, and utilize grains metadata and the Salt pillar. Additional topics covered in lecture &amp; labs include:
      runners, job &amp; event returners, event reactors, beacons, and orchestration.</p>
    <p>Practical aspects of Salt are also covered, including Salt-SSH, the Minion proc system, and Salt architectures and

            Survey 2017: "forward thinking organizations are pivoting toward a new model of cybersecurity that is agile, capable of
            acting on analytic inputs and adaptive to evolving risks and threats." DMI's cybersecurity solutions are designed to
            meet or exceed DHS' Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) requirements for automation and scalability. The result

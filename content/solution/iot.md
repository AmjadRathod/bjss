The Internet of Things (IoT) is a disrupting business processes and reshaping industries. Software and analytics on the other hand is driving change across all industries providing insight from the integration of devices and sensors. 


We take a holistic approach to deploying technology and aligning IT to the business. From the very beginning we build our solutions through a series of consultative ideation sessions and workshops to extract ideas and jointly create viable outcomes for the business.


This draws us into a collaboration with our clients to design, build and ultimately deploy the right IoT solution for them.


Our ability to drive an idea to outcome by having broad industry and technology expertise that spans idea generation, sensor integration, infrastructure modelling, big data analytics and application development provides a level of comfort to our clients.


Development of the IoT solution begins with feasibility and then the outline an implementation plan to ensure success when deployed into production.

Creating multiple end-to-end IoT architectures that include sensors and devices that collect data, networking infrastructure, storage and computing hardware, Hadoop databases, analytics software and visualisation tools. 


Our reference architectures include best practices that we’ve learned through the years and demonstrate a variety of critical variables—and the possibilities—to consider when integrating and deploying IoT solutions into a dynamic environment.


Access to hundreds of different hardware and software solutions made virtually accessible on-demand.


Let us show you how our methodology of focusing on business outcomes accelerates the use of your IoT technology investments.

# Big Data


> WWT can help you make the right investments in analytics, so you can extract just the information you need.


## Turn big data into business value


Big data is changing what you know. Today, your organization has access to more data about customers, products and
systems than ever before. But you can’t gain insights from unstructured data scattered across your enterprise.

WWT can help you make the right investments in analytics, so you can extract just the information you need. We’ll start
with a workshop to identify use cases that offer business value. Then, leveraging next-generation technology at our
Advanced Technology Center, we’ll perform a proof of concept by augmenting data warehousing with Hadoop-based
infrastructures.

A big data solution capable of scaling beyond the pilot phase depends on strategic planning. Our experts will build a
big data platform, architecture and analytics that take into account how layers speak to each other, as well as
appropriate configurations. This process ensures data is transferred accurately from its source throughout all parts of
your system.

Following a proof of concept, our customers roll out with live data that is processed and analyzed to provide meaningful
value. From there, we can provide training and workflows that help scale your big data platform across all parts of your
organization.

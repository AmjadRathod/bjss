Our Strong partnerships with third party vendors and global OEM’s ensure that speed in procurement of software as well any hardware dramatically reduces product lead time and increases predictability for our customers.  


Our processes utilise tight vendor and customer systems integration to make procurement as efficient as possible to support complex, time bound deployments.


Our International Integration Technology Centre is a lab environment designed to test functionality of technology deployments reducing the risk and costs of the project. This environment enables us to test, configure, and automate systems so that they’re ready to be deployed as soon as they are shipped to site or deployed to cloud .


We provide effective management processes to dramatically reduce the procurement time ensuring the right IT products are provisioned with the right configuration to the right place around the world.
